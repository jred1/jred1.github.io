Grass is an important aspect of a nature scene. It adds depth to the surface of the terrain, and can add a layer of immersion if it reacts to realtime forces, such as wind or walking on it. However, its use is typically avoided as much as possible in video games mainly for how graphically expensive it is to render. Most grass systems in games have short draw distances, lack player feedback, and have sparsely placed clumps of grass. The purpose of my grass system is to be able to overcome these shortcomings without sacrificing performance.
