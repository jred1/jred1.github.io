The visual quality of a game is a major contributing factor to how emmersive the experience is. However, better graphical fidelity isn't always the answer to a more emmersive experience as most games that attempt realism get stuck in the uncanny valley. The other apporach is stylism. Instead of getting closer to realism, stylized games aim to exaggerate certain aspects and leave others up to interpretation. The purpose of this post processing is to minimise the over-precistion of 3D rendering to create a more stylized portayal of a game.
