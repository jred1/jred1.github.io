  I am a high school student interested in programming, 3D printing, 3D sculping, and more. I use unity as a basis for my programming projects, and decided to use it to develop a VR game. So, all of my projects in unity are being created with the intention of being performant and compatible with VR. I also use Blender for 3D scuplting, Fusion 360 for hard surface modeling, and Visual Studio for programming in Python, C#, and HLSL. 
  This blog covers some of my projects in unity and some of my other creative endeavors.
